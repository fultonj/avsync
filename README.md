Audio Video Synchronization: How I import aligned video recorded with
LTC data from Reaper

- [avsync.sh](avsync.sh) automates the process described in [manual.md](manual.md). See [example.md](example.md).
- I also have helper scripts to [clean](clean.md) unwanted files or do a full [t7_wipe](t7_wipe.sh).
